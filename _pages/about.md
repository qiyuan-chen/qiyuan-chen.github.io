<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Qiyuan Chen (ÈôàÂêØÊ∫ê) and I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Central China Normal University. Since my sophomore year, I have been conducting research related to big data in education and natural language processing under the guidance of [Prof. Bo Li](http://maths.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1040/18436.htm) and [Dr. Haitong Yang](http://cs.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1158/2237.htm).

Starting from the fall of 2024, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Jian Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0004274) and [Dr. Jintai Chen](https://whatashot.github.io/). Also I work really closely with [Qian Shao](https://abeier87.github.io/) and [Hongsen Huang](https://github.com/SirlyDreamer).

My current research interests primarily include: **<span style="color:#8ECFC9">Tabular Data Prediction (TD)</span>** and **<span style="color:#82B0D2">Semi-Supervised Learning (SS)</span>**. Also I really interested in **<span style="color:#FA7F6F">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>** based on LLMs. Specifically,

* Neural Networks for Tabular Data
* Theory and Methods in Semi-Supervised Learning
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in LLMs
* Applications of AI (especially LLMs) in Finance

**Feel free to contact me if your research lies within these or related areas!**

In my free time, I really enjoy developing interesting websites and tools using Java (sometimes Python with FastAPI) and Vue.js. You can check out my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen) if you're interested.

I also enjoy digital devices (mechanical keyboards/NAS, etc.), badminton and chess in my spare time.

## 2. [ChatInterview](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen/ChatInterview) (Team Lead, Main Contributor)

This is a web-based tool that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to help job seekers **practice for interviews** using state-of-the-art technologies such as **RAG and Agent**.

As the team lead, I spearheaded both the **architectural design** and the development of backend algorithms.

**NOTE: Due to privacy considerations, this project will be fully open-sourced in the second half of 2024.**

## 3. [GPU Server Helper](https://github.com/qiyuan-chen/GPUServerHelper) (Still in Developing, Founder)

This is a web-based tool designed for **viewing and managing GPU server resources**, suitable for laboratories or research institutions to manage and schedule large numbers of GPU servers. 

I did all the coding for this project by **myself**, using FastAPI and Vue3.
